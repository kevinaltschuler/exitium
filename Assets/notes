how should players place walls?
 1. "draw" walls while moving, under player or behind?
 2. click and cast like moba


aiming?
 1. turning with movement, no mouse
 2. uncoupled aiming and movement, with mouse


most basic wall creation:

  dash that creates a wall
   maybe get thicker after .2 seconds
    useful if teammate is walking near edge and you need to quickly place a wall to save them
  placing grass


most basic destruction:





 todo:
 how to handle physics. im thinking extreme bounciness and low friction on the walls but high friction on the floor might work well
 explosions. √
 cooldown on abilities. √
 wall destruction after explosion
 mine destruction on explosion
 limit diagonal speed. currently its faster than horizontal and vertical
 rockets dont move you if they explode in you


 movement:
 dash 
    draw wall with dash
 stun on explosion √
 walljump kinda thing
  walljump effect 
  physics and determining if you can walljump or nah
 jump over walls √
 grappling hook √
  draw line √
  constant movement towards hit until youve reached it √
   dont be 100% straight on, if the player is moving then allow a little bit of DI during the hook √
  enter grapple state until then too √
 dodge roll - maybe

matteus suggestions:
    dash of which you can draw. so you hit the button then draw the vector then the force is applied when u release
    


 eventually:

 redo lighting
 animations
